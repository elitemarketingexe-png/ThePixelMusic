/**
 * Bounds a [ConcurrentHashMap] that is used as a TTL cache.
 *
 * Several lossless-source caches only ever dropped an entry when that exact key was looked up
 * again after expiry, so every distinct track played in a session left an entry behind for the
 * life of the process. Calling this right after a put keeps them bounded.
 *
 * - No-op while the map is at or under [maxSize] (the common case costs one `size` read).
 * - Over the cap: expired entries go first, then the soonest-to-expire ones, down to 75% of
 *   [maxSize] so the next few puts do not each pay for a trim.
 *
 * Only use this on maps whose eviction has no side effects: a caller that must release a
 * resource when an entry leaves the map (e.g. delete a temp file) needs its own eviction.
